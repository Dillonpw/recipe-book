# Recipe Book
The purpose of this project was to test some out the ease  of use between prisma and nextjs, and to also give me and my partner a place to turn for our favorite recipes without having to scroll foe ages and late loading ads just to cook a meal.

Of course the recipes could have been stored without the database and just in markdown but the point was to get my own experience with the tools using a free tier database.

Built with Next.js, React, Tailwind, Prisma, Noen Postgres
