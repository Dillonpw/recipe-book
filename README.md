# Recipe Book
The purpose of this project was to test some out the ease  of use between prisma and nextjs, and to also give me and my partner a place to turn for our favorite recipes without having to scroll for ages and late loading ads just to cook a meal.


Built with Next.js, React, Tailwind, Prisma, Supabase Postgres, Auth.js
